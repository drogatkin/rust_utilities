# Rust utilities (rust_utilities)

## Introduction

Learning a new language is always challenging. A good practice is a very important for an effective learning.
Some abstract exercises can be good for a beginning. But developing a small helpful program is even better.
It is hard to come to an idea of a unique application, especially if it should be not very complex. So I came to
the idea to develop already existing small utility, but with a particular specific for my needs.

## HV

Linux gives a good set utilities for hex view of a file, for example od. I work a lot with different audio formats.
So I came with specific requirements to view such files. As result, I implemented od applying my requirements.
I named the app as HexView.
