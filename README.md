# Rust utilities (rust_utilities)

## Introduction

Learning a new language is always challenging. A good practice is a very important for an effective learning.
Some abstract exercises can be good for a beginning. But developing a small helpful program is even better.
It is hard to come to an idea of a unique application, especially if it should be not very complex. So I came to
the idea to develop already existing small utility, but with a particular specific for my needs. About my take
of modern programming languages you can read in [the blog](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/rust-vs-kotlin-swift-c-dmitriy-rogatkin/).

## HV

Linux gives a good set utilities for hex view of a file, for example od. I work a lot with different audio formats.
So I came with specific requirements to view such files. As result, I implemented od applying my requirements.
I named the app as HexView.

## RB

The topic of build scripts will never end. It is an intermediate complexity app which always is a fun to build.
I did one for Java called as [7Bee](https://github.com/drogatkin/7Bee). So I used it for building Rust projects too,
but not anymore. RB is a Rust clone of the build tool with an updated syntax and some fun features. It implements
only a subset of the full 7Bee functionality, but it is enough to build my Rust projects. I decided to give a preview
version to those who could be interested to continue the work.
